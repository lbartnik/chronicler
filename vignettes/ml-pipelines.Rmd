# Introduction

Machine Learning pipelines spotted in the wild seem to be designed more
for __production environments__ and less for the __initial research__.
It shows in the data and processing models underlying the designs of
those pipelines, and in the APIs exposed to its users. One prominent
example of ML pipelines is the the `ML Flow` package which we will
analyze in this document.

We will start with definitions of __production environments__ and
__initial research__ and show why `ML Flow` is suited more for the
former. Then we will describe a model of user experience suited
better for the latter, implemented by the `chronicler` package.

# Two types of ML

## Initial research

## Production environment

# ML Flow

# Chronicler
