* bugfixes:
  * load chronicler when there is no repo in the filesystem; currently it breaks

1. break up Dockerfile into two stages:
   * chronicler-base: all deps
   * chronicler: github packages

2. Use in docs:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis
   https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DataExplorer/vignettes/dataexplorer-intro.html
   https://github.com/alexiscarter/BIOME/blob/master/Day3_AM/Lecture7_Reproducibility.pdf


prepare for presentation
  * make attaching to repository on load user-friendly
  * show how to identify files
  * deploy a sample repository into Docker image
  * make it possible to see the artifact after successful identification:
    either in the browser or in the console (?)

use scenarios:
  * identify artifact by file
  * full lineage of objects in a paper

add $ handling to defer
rename commits to steps? snapshots?
