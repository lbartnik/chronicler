1. break up Dockerfile into two stages:
   * chronicler-base: all deps
   * chronicler: github packages

prepare for presentation
  * make attaching to repository on load user-friendly
  * show how to identify files
  * deploy a sample repository into Docker image
  * make it possible to see the artifact after successful identification:
    either in the browser or in the console (?)

use scenarios:
  * identify artifact by file
  * full lineage of objects in a paper

add $ handling to defer
rename commits to steps? snapshots?
